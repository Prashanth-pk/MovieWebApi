# moviewebapi
## Technology Stack Used
    .NetCore 3.0, C# 8.0,EF Core, WebApi 
## Functionalities Yet To Be Added
    More Changes could be added to the current solution like as stated below.
	1: UnitTesting. I had time just to add the skeleton and was not able to implement it.
	2: Swagger for Api Documentation.
	3: Segregation of Model and Data part from the web project. Model/Entities can be added as a seperate project and 
	   could add those .dlls to the web so that each layer is independent and its easy to plug in and plug out features.
    4: Thinking about the architecture,if I had time,I would have created a  sql database and hosted/deployed it on Azure so that
	   it could  be scalable and access from everywhere rather than using inmemory database.
	5: Currently I have implemented inbuilt logging functionality using Logger but could also add third party logging
	   modules and inject it to the service/controller .
